# 📖 Library Management System

Welcome to my **Library Management System** — a Python-powered mini app that lets you organize, issue, and return books.

## 💡 About

This project is a simple command-line based system that manages books in a library. It’s written in clean, beginner-friendly Python and follows Object-Oriented Programming principles. Whether you're adding a new book, issuing it to a user, or just browsing the collection, this system has your back.

## 🛠️ Features

- 📚 Add new books to the library  
- ❌ Remove books that are no longer available  
- 👀 Display all books with status (Available / Issued)  
- 🔐 Issue a book to a user  
- 🌀 Return a previously issued book  
- 🧠 Simple, readable menu interface for users  

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack

- Language: Python 3.x  
- Concepts used: Classes, OOP, Lists, Control Flow, Pattern Matching (Python 3.10+)

I built this as a part of my learning journey in Python and OOP — because every coder starts somewhere, and this is my ode to books, code, and clean systems.
